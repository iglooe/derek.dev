## Introduction

This guide starts by booting into the live USB environment.

If you need help with the install, you need a USB formatted as FAT32 with the Arch
ISO written in the MBR partition scheme. You can use Rufus or Etcher to write the
ISO to the USB.

## I'm at the terminal, now what?

Let's set the font to an easier to read size.

```Shell
setfont ter-132n
```

Check internet connection.

```Shell
ping -c 3 archlinux.org
```

If you're on a wired connection, you should be good to go. If you're on Wi-Fi, you'll need to connect to your network by the following:

```Shell
iwctl
```

```Shell
device list
```

Verify `wlan0` shows up. If it does, show all nearby networks with the following command:

```Shell
station wlan0 get-networks
```

```Shell
station wlan0 connect ${Network name}
```

Enter the network passphrase

After entering the passphrase, wait about 5 seconds and press enter again

exit the `iwctl` tool

```Shell
exit
```

Check internet connection again.

```Shell
ping -c 3 archlinux.org
```

Synchronize the package database.

```Shell
pacman -Sy
```

Install arch keyring.

```Shell
pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
```

## Creating the partitions

List all disks and figure out your disk identifier.

```Shell
lsblk
```

> **Note**
> USB drives and SATA SSD drives will show up with the `SD` prefix.
>
> NVMe drives will show up with the `nvme` prefix.

Grab your disk identifier which will be the items without any children partitions inside of them
`sda`, `sdb`, `nvme0n1`, etc.

Prepare the disk for partitioning.

```Shell
cfdisk /dev/${disk_identifier}
```

Look for the `Free Space` option and press `Enter`.

You need **at least** 2 partitions and maybe an extra for swap RAM. The first partition is of the EFI system type and should be 1GB in size. The second partition is the root partition, which uses the default type of Linux Filesystem and should be anything 20Gb or higher.

Then select `Write` and type `yes` to confirm your partitions changes.

We still need to format the partitions.

Replace `${disk_identifier}` with your disk identifier and match the `${partition_number}` with the partition number. As long as you created the 1GB EFI partition first, this partition number will be N and the root partition will be N+1.

So in order it would be:

```Shell
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/${disk_identifier}${partition_number}
```

```Shell
mkfs.ext4 /dev/${disk_identifier}${partition_number}
```

Mounting the **root** partition `${disk_identifier}${N+1}`.

```Shell
mount /dev/${disk_identifier}${partition_number} /mnt
```

Create a directory inside the /mnt directory for the EFI partition.

```Shell
mkdir /mnt/boot
```

Mount the **EFI** partition `${disk_identifier}${N}`.

```Shell
mount /dev/${disk_identifier}${partition_number} /mnt/boot
```

Run `lsblk` to verify the partitions are mounted correctly.

## Installing the base system

```Shell
pacstrap -i /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware git sudo vim neofetch htop amd-ucode networkmanager
```

Accept the defaults and wait for the installation to finish.

Now lets mount the partitions off the live USB session with the following command:

```Shell
genstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

Verify the contents of the fstab file.

```Shell
cat /mnt/etc/fstab
```

Lastly chroot into the new system.

```Shell
arch-chroot /mnt
```

The prompt should change to reflect the new root directory.

Set your root password

```Shell
passwd
```

Create a standard user that you will use

```Shell
useradd -m -g users -G wheel,storage,power,video,audio -s /bin/bash ${username}
```

Set the password for the new user

```Shell
passwd ${username}
```

Enable the new user to use `sudo`

```Shell
EDITOR=vim visudo
```

Uncomment the line `%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL` and save the file.

**Optional**

Verify the new user can use `sudo`

```Shell
su - ${username}
```

Your shell should change again to reflect the new user. Simply type exit to return to the root user.

## Configuring the system

Set the timezone

```Shell
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago /etc/localtime
```

Sync the hardware clock

```Shell
hwclock --systohc
```

Edit the locale.gen file

```Shell
vim /etc/locale.gen
```

Uncomment the line `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8` and save the file.

Generate the locale

```Shell
locale-gen
```

Create the locale.conf file

```Shell
vim /etc/locale.conf
```

Add the following line to the file: `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`. Save the changes and exit.

Set the hostname

```Shell
vim /etc/hostname
```

Add your hostname to the file and save it.

Edit the hosts file

```Shell
vim /etc/hosts
```

Add the following lines to the file:

```Shell
127.0.0.1  localhost
::1        localhost
127.0.1.1  ${hostname}.localdomain ${hostname}
```
