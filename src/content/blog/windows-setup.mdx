# Dictum fusce ut placerat orci nulla pellentesque dignissim

Sagittis aliquam malesuada bibendum arcu vitae elementum curabitur vitae nunc sed velit dignissim sodales ut eu sem integer vitae justo eget magna fermentum iaculis eu non diam phasellus vestibulum lorem sed risus ultricies tristique nulla aliquet enim tortor at auctor urna nunc id cursus metus aliquam eleifend mi in nulla posuere sollicitudin aliquam ultrices sagittis orci a scelerisque purus semper.

## Ut Tortor

A lacus vestibulum sed arcu non odio euismod lacinia:

- **Next.js** for the framework, providing server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling, offering a utility-first approach to design.
- **shadcn/ui** for UI components, ensuring a sleek and modern user interface.
- **TanStack/react-table** for the table package, enabling flexible and extensible tables.
- **Neon** for the database, offering scalable POSTGRESSQL-compatible databases.
- **Drizzle ORM** for object-relational mapping, simplifying database interactions.
- **Zod** for validation, ensuring data integrity through TypeScript-first schema definition.
- **million** for the optimizing compiler, enhancing performance and efficiency.

## Key Features

The integration of shadcn/ui with Tanstack Table boasts several advanced features:

- **Server-Side Actions**: Pagination, sorting, and filtering are handled server-side, reducing the load on the client and improving performance.
- **Customizable Columns**: Users can define columns as per their requirements, ensuring flexibility.
- **Dynamic Inputs**: Search and filters are debounced and faceted, respectively, enhancing the user experience by reducing lag and providing relevant filtering options.
- **Advanced Filtering**: An optional Notion-like filtering feature allows for complex query building.
- **Row selection Actions**: Selected rows can trigger actions such as deletion, with an optional floating bar for context-specific operations.
- **Reusability**: The reusable `useDataTable` hook can be used to quickly build tables with server-side actions.

## Conclusion

I'm really grateful to Kavin Desi Valli for creating the dynamic filtering function for the table using `drizzle-orm`. Make sure to check out his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@livecode247) for more amazing content on web development.
